# YouSSH

A simple GUI for forwarding ports from native apps and docker containers running on remote hosts over SSH. Inspired by VSCode's port forwarding behaviour, minus the need to open multiple IDE windows for each machine. Built to make life simpler when developing on multiple remote hosts with multiple services. Can also be used if you ,like me, cannot ever remember the ssh port forwarding syntax.

## Features
- Connect to Hosts in the `~/.ssh/config` file
- Index Ports listening on remote hosts
- Forward Remote Ports to localhost
